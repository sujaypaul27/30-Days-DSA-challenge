TWO POINTER TECHNIQUE (DSA)

WHAT IS TWO POINTER?

Two Pointer is a technique where we use
two indexes (pointers) to traverse a data structure
instead of using nested loops.

Usually used to reduce Time Complexity from O(n²) → O(n).

SPECIAL KEYWORDS (REMEMBER THESE)

left pointer

right pointer

start and end

slow and fast

move pointers based on condition

sorted array

optimize brute force

avoid nested loops

WHEN TO USE TWO POINTER?

Use Two Pointer when you see:

✅ Sorted Array / Sorted String

✅ Pairs / Triplets / Subarray problems

✅ Compare elements from both ends

✅ Need O(n) or O(n log n) solution

✅ Brute force uses nested loops

✅ Questions with conditions like sum, difference, target

WHERE TO USE TWO POINTER?

Most commonly used in:

Arrays

Strings

Linked Lists

TYPES OF TWO POINTER

OPPOSITE DIRECTION POINTERS

One pointer starts from beginning

One pointer starts from end

left → ← right

USED WHEN:

Array/String is sorted

Need pair sum, reverse, palindrome check

EXAMPLES:

Two Sum (sorted array)

Reverse array

Check palindrome

Container with most water

SAME DIRECTION POINTERS

Both pointers move from left to right

One pointer is usually slow

Other pointer is fast

slow → fast →

USED WHEN:

Remove duplicates

Sliding window

Detect cycles

Partition problems

EXAMPLES:

Remove duplicates from sorted array

Move zeros

Longest substring

Linked List cycle detection

HOW POINTERS MOVE (IMPORTANT)

If condition satisfied → move one pointer

If condition not satisfied → move the other pointer

Never move both blindly

Pointer movement depends on problem condition

WHY TWO POINTER IS IMPORTANT?

Reduces Time Complexity

Cleaner logic

Highly preferred in interviews

Foundation for:

Sliding Window

Fast & Slow pointer

Binary Search variations

INTERVIEW SIGNAL WORDS (BIG HINT 🚨)

If interviewer says:

“Optimize this”

“Avoid nested loop”

“Sorted array”

“Find pair”

“Check condition between two elements”
