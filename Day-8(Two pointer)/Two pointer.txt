TWO POINTER TECHNIQUE (DSA)

WHAT IS TWO POINTER?

Two Pointer is a technique where we use
two indexes (pointers) to traverse a data structure
instead of using nested loops.

Main goal:
Reduce Time Complexity from O(n^2) to O(n)

SPECIAL KEYWORDS (VERY IMPORTANT)

left pointer
right pointer
start and end
slow pointer
fast pointer
sorted array
pair / triplet
target condition
optimize brute force
avoid nested loops

WHEN TO USE TWO POINTER?

Use Two Pointer when you see:

Sorted array or sorted string

Finding pair / triplet

Comparing elements

Brute force solution uses nested loops

Need optimized O(n) solution

Questions with sum, difference, target

WHERE TO USE TWO POINTER?

Mostly used in:

Arrays

Strings

Linked Lists

TYPES OF TWO POINTER

TYPE 1: OPPOSITE DIRECTION POINTERS

One pointer starts from beginning
One pointer starts from end

left -> <- right

USED WHEN:

Data is sorted

Comparing two ends

Pair sum or reverse type problems

EXAMPLES:

Two Sum (sorted array)

Reverse array

Palindrome check

Container with most water

TYPE 2: SAME DIRECTION POINTERS

Both pointers move from left to right

slow -> fast ->

USED WHEN:

Remove duplicates

Sliding window problems

Partitioning

Cycle detection

EXAMPLES:

Remove duplicates from sorted array

Move zeros

Longest substring

Linked List cycle detection

HOW POINTERS MOVE

Move pointer based on condition

Do NOT move both blindly

Each move depends on problem logic

WHY TWO POINTER IS IMPORTANT?

Improves performance

Cleaner and simpler code

Frequently asked in interviews

Base for sliding window and fast-slow patterns

INTERVIEW HINT WORDS

If you hear:

Optimize
Sorted array
Avoid nested loop
Find pair
Compare elements

Think immediately: TWO POINTER

ONE LINE SUMMARY

Two Pointer is a technique that uses two indexes
to solve problems efficiently in linear time.
