What is Time Complexity?

Time Complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm grows as the input size n increases.
It helps estimate algorithm performance, especially for large inputs.

Common Time Complexities:

Time Complexity | Description | Example
O(1) | Constant time | Accessing an array element
O(log n) | Logarithmic time | Binary Search
O(n) | Linear time | Loop through an array
O(n log n) | Log-linear time | Merge Sort, Quick Sort (average)
O(n²) | Quadratic time | Nested loops
O(2ⁿ) | Exponential time | Recursive Fibonacci
O(n!) | Factorial time | N-Queens (brute force)

What is Space Complexity?

Space Complexity measures how much extra memory an algorithm uses relative to input size n.

It includes:

Function call stack

Auxiliary arrays or data structures

Variables used in computation

(Note: Input storage is usually not counted.)

Common Space Complexities:

Space Complexity | Description | Example
O(1) | Constant space | Few variables only
O(n) | Linear space | Extra array
O(log n) | Logarithmic space | Binary Search recursion
O(n²) | Quadratic space | Matrix / 2D array problems
